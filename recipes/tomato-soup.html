                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This tomato soup recipe uses a french technique called confit. This slowly cooks all of the ingredients in oil to give them a rich and deep flavor. Then it is blended to give it the smooth and creamy texture that you know and love. Optionally you can garnish it with a drizzle of olive oil, heavy cream, a couple fresh basil leaves and a dusting of freshly grated parmesan cheese. </p>

                <h3>Method of Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, preheat your oven to 375 degrees.</li>
                    <li>While your oven is preheating, measure out all of the ingredients that you will be using. Once they are measured, set them aside and set up a cutting board.</li>
                    <li>Thinly slice your onion and set it aside with other ingredients. Hooray! That's all the knife work that you will need.</li>
                    <li>Now wrap your sprigs of oregano with your basil leaves and tie together with butcher's twine, this is called an herb sache. Its best to have the largest basil leaf on the outside so it holds everything together.</li>
                    <li>Grab the largest pot you have and add the onion, garlic, calabrian chilies in oil, water, and your herb sache to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                    <li>Gently pour your tomatoes over the top being careful not to unsettle any of the ingredients at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Gently pour the olive oil over your tomatoes so the oil covers all or most of the surface of the tomatoes. It's ok if there is a little bit showing but you want to try to get everything under the oil.</li>
                    <li>Once your oven is preheated, place the pot in, uncovered, and cook for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>After an hour, remove from the oven and remove the herb sachet. Don't worry if some of the herbs fall off, we mainly just want to get rid of the butchers twine.</li>
                    <li>Blend until its a smooth and homogenous mixture, using a regular blender or immersion blender. Note, if you are using a regular blender, you will have to do it in small batches.</li>
                    <li>Once everything is blended, pass the soup through a fine mesh strainer to remove any small debris that was not blended.</li>
                    <li>The soup is ready to serve! If you want to spice it up a bit, drizzle some olive oil and heavy cream on top. Grate a little parmesan cheese and throw a couple of fresh basil leaves on there for some color contrast and freshness.</li>
                    <li>Bon Appetit!</li>
