                <h3>Method of Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, add half of the water to the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
                    <li>Add the yeast and the honey to the bowl. Mix thoroughly and let sit for 10 mins uncovered.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour, salt and remaining water. Mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until just combined, about 5 mins. Stop mixing occasionally to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Grab the edge of the dough and old in onto itself. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat until you've done all four sides. Cover and rest for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Oil your hands and remove the dough from the bowl. Form into a tight ball. Pour a small amount of oil into a medium size baking tray and place the dough into, seam side down. Pour a little more oil onto the top of the dough. Cover and rest for an additional hour. </li>
                    <li>Uncover the dough, oil your hands once more, gently stretch the dough out until it fills the pan. If your hands are sticking, add more oil. Trust me you cannot use too much olive oil in this recipe. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the dough is resting for its last time, preheat your oven to 450 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Uncover the dough, sprinkle a little salt and a bunch of fresh rosemary leaves right on top. Place in the oven uncovered for 18-22 minutes. Check at 18 minutes and go to 22 if it's too light.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. After about 15 mins you are ready to eat!</li>
                    <li>To store the extras, place in a zip-lock bag and refrigerate for up to 5 days.</li>
                </ol>
